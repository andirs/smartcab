QUESTION: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions. Does the smartcab eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?

While performing random actions there are a couple observations one can make:
* The agent reaches the goal 'by accident'
* When crashing, cars will restart at a different location and start to drive
* There is a reward system in place that shows the immediate gratification of an action
* There are 3 other agents or cars in play
